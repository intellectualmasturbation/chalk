Introduction :- In our daily lives, we often see people arguing about a lot of different things. For example - "who's the best singer?", "which movie is better?", "Is there life after death?", "What tax measures should be taken?" etc. The interesting aspect of these discussions isn't that they take place, but that they almost never reach a definite meaningful conclusion. Why is that?
        In this essay, we are going to try and find an answer to that question and discuss the implementations of that answer.
       But  before that , we need to familiarize ourselves with a few terms and their definitions.

A few terns and their definitions :-

Subject :- An entity that's capable of conscious experience.

Subjective :- Conscious experiences such as feelings, taste, opinions etc.

Objective :- Objects that exist or facts that are true outside of conscious experiences.
       After reading the above definitions, it might appear that the subjective and the objective exist within fundamentally different realms and are inherently incompatible with each other. However, that is not the case. I'll demonstrate this with two examples.

Example 1 :- Imagine that there's a rope hanging from the brunches of a tree. A subject sees the rope and mistakenly thinks that it's a snake. Subsequently he runs away.
        In this example, what the subject sees is a conscious experience  ( subjective ) which is unrelated to what's factually true  ( objective ). The rope isn't actually a snake.

Example 2 :- Imagine that a bottle is situated on a table. A subject sees the bottle and forms the following belief - " There's a bottle on the table ".
       In this example, a formulated belief is also a conscious experience  ( subjective ). But contrary to the previous example , it's not unrelated to what is factually true (objective ). The information contained within it accurately describes the objective state of the environment around him.

Note that beliefs are intrinsically subjective as they are conscious experiences that cannot exist outside of sentience. But despite that, we consider some beliefs to be objective. As has been demonstrated above, subjective experiences aren't fundamentally incompatible with objective reality and as humans the only way for us to acquire knowledge is through conscious experience. Hence, to avoid complications, we categorize beliefs that accurately describe reality as " Objective /objectively true " and those that don't as " Subjective /objectively not true ". In other words, we use " Consistency with reality " as a metric to determine a belief's "objectivity ".

Now that the required definitions have been established, let's get into the meat of the discussion.

What is preference :- A preference for a certain object or idea or state of being is the liking for that object or idea or state of being over other objects or ideas or states of being. Preferences are conscious experiences as they cannot exist outside of a subject's mind and thus, are inherently subjective. They are also totally arbitrary. One cannot reason himself into liking something. Neither can one point to an object in reality that tells us what one should prefer. In case of humans, the genetic makeup of a subject endows him with a collection of preferences. Then, new ones are formed through interactions with his surrounding environment. In case of inferior animals the later process doesn't take place.

The role of preference in the lives of conscious entities :- For a conscious entity, without a goal there's no reason to act. Preferences serve exactly this purpose. They provide conscious entities with goals. They act as catalysts for action.

Through the complex process of evolution life forms on earth have introduced different inborn preferences that they inherit genetically. One the more important of these, that's also universally shared, is " the preference to live ". Every life form would rather live than die and that provides them with a goal. And for at least the vast majority of life forms that are inferior to humans, almost every action that they take is regulated by this singular goal. They gather food because they want to live. They find shelter because they want to live. They tussle with hostile environments because they want to live etc. Humans do all of these, and more. Humans have vastly superior cognitive abilities. Consequently, in addition to all of the above, they also make paintings, solve mathematical problems, build statues and architectural structures etc. These activities aren't regulated by the goal of surviving , they are facilitated by the inclination to create, which importantly, is also a preference.

Now to understand how "preference" creates problems, we have a understand the two fundamental classes of questions, subjective questions and objective questions.

Subjective questions :- In essence, subjective questions don't really ask anything about the objective world. They only ask about the relative position of an object or a subject in relation to a subject contract /s. To further demonstrate, let's take an example from the introduction - " Which vocalist is the better singer? " -the nature of the answer that this question seeks isn't objective. Good and bad are relative. What is good/bad depends on a particular subject's preferences or goals. Nothing is intrinsically good or bad. Therefore, good and bad are subjective constructs. In light of this, the above question can be framed in the following way - " which vocalist sings in a manner that's more in line with what I prefer " - as can be understood from the above, the question asks about the relative positions of the vocalists in relation to the subjective constructs of " good and bad " that emerge out of preferences. These positions solely determine their goodness or badness.

Objective questions :- These kind of questions only ask about the relative position of an object or a subject in relation to the objective world, or its history of reaching a certain relative position, or its objective states.

"Where is my pen?" - this question only asks about the relative position of the pen in relation to the objective world.

"How did it end up being on the table?" - this question only asks about some of the past relative positions of the pen.

"What is the color of my pen?" - this question only asks about a specific objective state of the pen. The answers to all of the above questions are independent of all possible subjective constructs.
