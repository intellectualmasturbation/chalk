Introduction 
============
In our daily lives, we often see people arguing about a lot of different things. For example - "who's the best singer?", "which movie is better?", "Is there life after death?", "What tax measures should be taken?" etc. The interesting aspect of these discussions isn't that they take place, but that they almost never reach a definite meaningful conclusion. Why is that? 

In this essay, we are going to try and find an answer to that question and discuss the implementations of that answer. But  before that , we need to familiarize ourselves with a few terms and their definitions.

A few terns and their definitions
=============================
Subject:- An entity that's capable of conscious experience.

Subjective:- Conscious experiences such as feelings, taste, opinions etc.

Objective:- Objects that exist or facts that are true outside of conscious experiences. 

After reading the above definitions, it might appear that the subjective and the objective exist within fundamentally different realms and are inherently incompatible with each other. However, that is not the case. I'll demonstrate this with two examples.

Example 1:- Imagine that there's a rope hanging from the branches of a tree. A subject sees the rope and mistakenly thinks that it's a snake. Subsequently he runs away. 

In this example, what the subject sees is a conscious experience (subjective) which is unrelated to what's factually true (ojective). The rope isn't actually a snake.

Example 2:- Imagine that a bottle is situated on a table. A subject sees the bottle and forms the following belief - "There's a bottle on the table". 

In this example, the formulated belief is also a conscious experience (subjective). But contrary to the previous example, it's not unrelated to what is factually true (objective). The information contained within it accurately describes the objective state of the environment around him.

Note that beliefs are intrinsically subjective as they are conscious experiences that cannot exist outside of sentience. But despite that, we consider some beliefs to be objective. As has been demonstrated above, subjective experiences aren't fundamentally incompatible with objective reality and as humans the only way for us to aquire knowledge is through conscious experience. Hence, to avoid complications, we catagorize beliefs that accurately describe reality as "Objective /objectively true" and those that don't as "Subjective /objectively not true". In other words, we use "Consistency with reality" as a metric to determine a belief's "objectivity".

Now that the required definitions have been established, let's get into the meat of the discussion.

What is preference
=================
A preference for a certain object or idea or state of being is the liking for that object or idea or state of being over other objects or ideas or states of being. Preferences are conscious experiences as they cannot exist outside of a subject's mind and thus, are inherently subjective. They are also totally arbitrary. One cannot reason himself into liking something. Neither can one point to an object in reality that delineates what one should prefer. In case of humans, the genetic makeup of a subject endows him with a collection of preferences. Then, new ones are formed through interactions with his surrounding environment. In case of inferior animals, the later process doesn't take place.

The role of preference in the lives of conscious entities 
===============================================
For a conscious entity, without a goal there's no reason to act. Preferences serve exactly this purpose. They provide conscious entities with goals. They act as catalysts for action.

Through the complex process of evolution life forms on earth have introduced different inborn preferences that they inherit genetically. One of the more important of these, which is also universally shared, is " the preference to live ". Every life form would rather live than die and that provides them with a goal. And for at least the vast majority of life forms that are inferior to humans, almost every action that they perform is regulated by this singular goal. They gather food because they want to live. They find shelter because they want to live. They tussle with hostile environments because they want to live etc. Humans do all of these, and more. Humans have vastly superior cognitive abilities. Consequently, in addition to all of the above, they also make paintings, solve mathematical problems, build statues and architectural structures etc. These activities aren't regulated by the goal of surviving , they are facilitated by the inclination to create, which importantly, is also a preference.

Now to understand how "preference" creates problems, we have a understand the two fundamental classes of questions, subjective questions and objective questions.

Two different classes of questions 
=============================
Subjective questions:- In essence, subjective questions don't really ask anything about the objective world. They only ask about the relative position of an object or a subject in relation to subjective constructs. To further demonstrate, let's take an example from the introduction - "Which vocalist is the better singer?" - the nature of the answer that this question seeks isn't objective. Good and bad are relative. What is good/bad depends on a particular subject's preferences or goals. Nothing is intrinsically good or bad. Therefore, good and bad are subjective constructs. In light of this, the above question can be framed in the following way - "which vocalist sings in a manner that's more in line with what I prefer" - as can be understood from the above, the question asks about the relative positions of the vocalists in relation to the subjective constructs of "good and bad" that emerge out of preferences. These positions solely determine their goodness or badness.

Objective questions :- These kind of questions only ask about the relative position of an object or a subject in relation to the objective world, or its history of reaching a certain relative position, or its objective states. 

" Where is my pen? " - this question only asks about the relative position of the pen in relation to the objective world.

"How did it end up being on the table?" - this question only asks about some of the past relative positions of the pen.

"What is the color of my pen?" - this question only asks about a specific objective state of the pen. Note that the answers to all of the above questions are independent of all possible subjective constructs.

How "preference" creates problems  
===============================
As has been stated before, subjective questions are relative to preferential constructs, which emerge out of preferences. Hence, if the relevant preferences of the subjects involved in the solving of a subjective question differ, it becomes impossible to solve the question. In cases like this, the relative position of what the question asks something about, differs in relation the preferential constructs of the subjects involved. Consequently, different subjects reach to different conclusions. Problems arise when they try to assign objectivity to their conclusions or intiate action by denying validity to other conclusions. Let's again take the example of the "vocalist question" from the introduction. By virtue of it being a subjective question, different subjects will reach to different conclusions. And if any one of them then initiates action, such as declaring a vocalist as the winner of a certain singing competition, based solely on his conclusion, problems will arise. However, this problem isn't limited to subjective questions. 

Every subject has a hierarchy of preferences. The structure of this hierarchy depends on the subject's biological nature (i.e genetic nmakeup, hormone levels etc) and lived experiences (i.e memories of past interactions with the environment). And its actions are determined by it. This becomes more obvious in complex situations. Imagine that a human, along with his mother and wife, is on a sinking boat and there are only two life jackets available. In this scenario, he has four distinct options. He could - 1. Save his mother and himself 2. Save his wife and himself 3. Save his mother and wife, letting himself drown, or 4. Destroy the life jackets. Which one he will indeed choose depends on the structure of his preference hierarchy. 

Depending on the specific structure of hierarchy a subject retains, as in having a higher preference for one thing, lesser for another, it can also develop preferences for certain solutions to objective questions. Not all solutions are 'right'. Therefore, it follows that subjects are capable of developing preferences for 'wrong' answers too. Manifestations of this phenomena can be seen everywhere. People often deny to accept facts even after being proven wrong. They don't do that because they are confident of their knowledge. They do that because in their minds, they HAVE to be right. In their preference hierarchy, "don't look like a fool" is situated higher than "truth at any cost". As is evident, this can be quite problematic. Following is a diagram for further clarity.

Justification of beliefs
====================
If preferences are intrinsically subjective and if all beliefs are predicated on preferences, does that mean all beliefs are justified?

No subject is above "preference" as they are the prime drivers of action. And a subject's beliefs are all regulated by its preferences. But a beliefs justification is dependent on its validity as a proposition. And its validity is dependent on how consistent it is with reality. 

Let's take the example of Adolf Hitler. His entire worldview is based on the belief of Aryan superiority. Whether he came to this conclusion because of his hatred for Jews (preference) or pondering, I don't know. But as a proposition, it isn't justified as it's not consistent with reality. Yet, throughout his entire life, he held on to it. Because he developed a preference for the proposition itself. At that stage it didn't matter to him whether it was justified or not. He just didn't care. 

Let's further take the example of a suicide bomber. A suicide bomber believes that if he sacrafices himself for God and manages to kill a bunch of "infidels", he will achieve a place in heaven. Through whatever unreason he came to this conclusion, his preference for this belief is even greater than his preference for survival. Yet, as a proposition, it isn't justified as it's not consistent with reality. There's no heaven up in the sky. 

In actuality, when we criticize someone's beliefs, we only question the validity of their beliefs as propositions. We don't criticize their preference for the beliefs. We can't. Because preferences are arbitrary and inherently subjective. Just as criticizing someone for their liking of a certain color doesn't make sense, criticizing someone's preference for a certain belief also doesn't make sense. This is the essence of the "preference problem". If someone doesn't care about rationality (which is also a preference), it's impossible to reason him out of unjustified (irrational) beliefs. Because he doesn't care about justification or validity. He just wants to believe. 

(Note that not all questions are objective. Questions like "who is the better singer" can't be answered objectively. But central to the above two examples are propositions that are very much objectively determinable). 

The nature of conflicts 
====================
Conflicts always arise out of preferential differences and that's really obvious in case of inferior animals. Every one of them holds the "preference to live" as prime. And through evolution, animals on earth have evolved in such a way that to exercise this "prime" preference, they have to kill other living entities that also hold that same preference. This results in much conflict. Tigers are flesh eating animals. They have to kill in order to live. So they kill cows, goats, dears etc. But these animals want to live as well. Hence the chaos. In case humans though, it's much more subtle. Consider the conflict between an atheist and a suicide bomber. At first it might seem to be a conflict of reason. But on further contemplation, it becomes clear that it's deeper than that. Even though their beliefs have different degrees of validity, the core of the conflict doesn't lie there. The athiest would happily settle the issue through debate, but the suicide bomber wouldn't. That's because the atheist cares about rationality and wants to live, the suicide bomber cares only about heaven and has no intention of living among mere mortals. This preferential difference is the source of the conflict. In order for an issue to be settled through debate, it requires that both parties care about rationality. But that's also a matter of preference. Some would rather blow things up, including themselves. Thus, suicide bombers exist. 

(Note again that not all questions are objective. "Who is the better singer" can't be resolved through debate. It's a subjective question. But whether heaven exists or not is certainly an objective one)

Conclusion 
===========
So then, what's the solution to this mess? I don't think there is one. If somehow the number of people who care about rationality increases, there's a good chance that at least physical conflicts will slowly dissipate. I have also crafted a list of principles that, I think, if followed by a sufficient number of people, would decrease the number of physical conflicts. The principle are as follows - 

1. Determine whether a question is subjective or objective.

2. Understand that it's futile to try and give objective answers to subjective questions. So it's only rational to avoid fighting over such questions.

3. Try to distance yourself from preferential bias whenever the heart of the issue is objectively determinable. 

4. Try not to develop preferences that are, or could be in conflict with someone else's "preference to live".

As is clear, these principles are directly opposed to a lot of people's already held preferences. Therefore, these probably wouldn't be much effective as well. 

So to end this essay, I will state the now obvious. As long as the capacity to hold preferences continues to permeate the entirety of conscious existence, suffering will prevail. Meaning that as long as there's life, there will be suffering, for a conscious entity that doesn't wish or want might as well be dead.
