            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In our daily lives, we often see people arguing about many different things. For example - “who’s the best singer?”, “which movie is better?”, “Is there life after death?”, “What tax measures should be taken?” etc. The interesting aspect of these discussions isn’t that they take place, but that they seldom reach a definite meaningful conclusion. Why is that?</p>

<p>In this essay, we are going to try and find an answer to that question and discuss the implications of that answer. But before that, we need to familiarize ourselves with a few terms and their definitions.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-terms-and-their-definitions">A few terms and their definitions</h2>
<p><strong>Subject -</strong> An entity that’s capable of conscious experience.</p>

<p><strong>Subjective -</strong> Conscious experiences such as feelings, taste, opinions etc.</p>

<p><strong>Objective -</strong> Objects that exist or facts that are true outside of conscious experiences.</p>

<p>After reading the above definitions, it might appear that the subjective and the objective exist within fundamentally different realms and are inherently incompatible with each other. However, that is not the case. I’ll demonstrate this with two examples.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1 -</strong> Imagine that there’s a rope hanging from the branches of a tree. A subject sees the rope and mistakenly thinks that it’s a snake. Subsequently, he runs away.</p>

<p>In this example, what the subject sees is a conscious experience (subjective) which is unrelated to what’s factually true (objective). The rope isn’t actually a snake.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2 -</strong> Imagine that a bottle is situated on a table. A subject sees the bottle and forms the following belief - “There’s a bottle on the table”.</p>

<p>The formulated belief in this example is also a conscious experience (subjective). But contrary to the one in the previous example, it’s not unrelated to what is factually true (objective). The information it contains accurately describes the objective state of its surrounding environment.</p>

<p>Note that beliefs are intrinsically subjective as they are conscious experiences that cannot exist outside of sentience. Despite that, we consider some beliefs to be objective. As has been demonstrated above, subjective experiences aren’t fundamentally incompatible with objective reality and as humans, the only way for us to acquire knowledge is through conscious experience. Hence, to avoid complications, we categorize beliefs that accurately describe reality as “Objective/objectively true” and those that don’t as “Subjective/objectively not true”. In other words, we use “Consistency with reality” as a metric to determine the objectivity of beliefs. I’ll use this utilitarian definition throughout this essay.</p>

<p>Now that the required definitions have been established, let’s get into the meat of the discussion.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-preference">What is “preference”</h2>
<p>A preference for a certain object or idea or state of being is the liking for that object or idea or state of being over other objects or ideas or states of being. Preferences are conscious experiences as they cannot exist outside of a subject’s mind. Furthermore, they don’t describe anything about the objective world. So there’s no question of them being consistent with reality. Therefore, preferences are inherently subjective. They are also totally arbitrary. One cannot reason himself into liking something. Neither can one point to an object in reality that delineates what one should prefer. In case of humans, the genetic makeup of a subject endows him with a collection of preferences. Then, new ones are formed through interactions with his surrounding environment. In case of inferior animals, the scope of the later process is very limited.</p>

<h2 id="the-role-of-preference-in-the-lives-of-conscious-entities">The role of “preference” in the lives of conscious entities</h2>
<p>For a conscious entity, without a goal there’s no reason to act. Preferences serve exactly this purpose. They provide conscious entities with goals. They act as catalysts for action.</p>

<p>Through the complex process of evolution life forms on earth have introduced different inborn preferences that they inherit genetically. One of the more important of these, which is also universally shared, is “the preference to live”. Every life form would rather live than die and that provides them with a goal. And for at least the vast majority of life forms that are inferior to humans, almost every action that they perform is regulated by this singular goal. They gather food because they want to live. They find shelter because they want to live. They tussle with hostile environments because they want to live etc. Humans do all of these, and more.</p>

<p>Humans have vastly superior cognitive abilities. Consequently, in addition to all of the above, they also make paintings, solve mathematical problems, build statues and architectural structures etc. These activities aren’t regulated by the goal of surviving, they are facilitated by the inclination to create, which importantly, is also a preference.</p>

<p>Now to understand how “preference” creates problems, we have to understand the nature of the two fundamental classes of questions, subjective questions and objective questions, and the definition of an additional term. Let me define the term first as it will be needed to apprehend the former.</p>

<h2 id="preferential-constructs">Preferential Constructs</h2>
<p>Preferential constructs are constructs the sole function of which is to justify preferences. This doesn’t imply that all ideas are preferential constructs. Ideas are basically constructs of the subject mind (the word “subject” is being used here instead of “human” in order to incorporate all possible conscious entities). Therefore, they are all products of conscious pursuit. As conscious pursuits are solely driven by preferences, it may seem that hence, all ideas are preferential constructs. Although that isn’t true. Not all ideas are justifications of preferences even though all of them are necessarily products of “the exercise of preference”. Basic mathematical ideas such as subtraction, addition, multiplication were developed by people who wanted to effectively count and keep track of the quantity of objects around them. More advanced mathematical ideas such as Euclidean geometry, calculus were developed by people who wanted to explain some phenomenon or just liked doing maths. So these ideas are products of the human mind’s exercise of preference. However, these aren’t preferential constructs as they do not attempt to justify the preferences out of which they emerged. On the other hand, “Mathematics is good for civilization” is a preferential construct because it’s a justification of a specific preference.</p>

<p>Note that as preferences are inherently subjective and arbitrary and do not in any way describe the objective world, justifications of preferences are also subjective and arbitrary. Preferential constructs merely assert, do not prove, that a certain preference is justified. They presume what they wish to establish to be the premise itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mathematics should be exercised because it’s good for mankind”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above argument can be translated into the following -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Anything that I like is good”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I like what mathematics does for mankind”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Therefore, mathematics should be exercised as it’s good”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that after translation, it becomes clear that the above argument uses the very preference that it seeks to justify as its premise. It’s also a preferential construct as it seeks to justify a certain exercise of preference (in this case, doing maths).</p>

<p>Typical examples of preferential constructs are values, ideas of goodness and badness, prescriptions of behavior etc.</p>

<h2 id="two-different-classes-of-questions">Two different classes of questions</h2>
<p><strong>Subjective questions -</strong> In essence, subjective questions don’t really ask anything about the objective world. They only ask about the relative position of a subject or an object in relation to preferential constructs. To further expand, let’s take an example from the introduction -</p>

<p>“<em>Which vocalist is the better singer?</em>”</p>

<p>The nature of the answer that this question seeks isn’t objective. Good and bad are relative. Whether something is good or bad depends on the preferences or goals of the subject asking the question. In other words, good and bad are terms that attempt to justify preferences. Therefore, good and bad are preferential constructs. In light of this, the above question can be framed in the following way - “which vocalist sings in a manner that’s more in line with what I prefer” - as can be understood, the question only asks about the relative positions of the vocalists in relation to the preferential constructs of “good and bad”. These positions solely determine their goodness or badness.</p>

<p><strong>Objective questions -</strong> This kind of questions only ask about the relative position of a subject or an object in relation to the objective world, or its history of reaching a certain relative position, or its objective states.</p>

<p>“<em>Where is my pen?</em>” - This question only asks about the relative position of the pen in relation to the objective world.</p>

<p>“<em>How did it end up on the table?</em>” - This question only asks about some of the past relative positions of the pen.</p>

<p>“<em>What is the color of my pen?</em>” - This question only asks about a specific objective state of the pen.</p>

<p>Note that the answers to all the above questions are independent of all possible preferential constructs.</p>

<h2 id="how-preference-creates-problems">How “preference” creates problems</h2>
<p>As has been established already, subjective questions are relative to preferential constructs the sole function of which is to justify preferences. Hence, if the relevant preferences of the subjects involved in the solving of a subjective question differ, it becomes impossible to solve the question. In cases like this, the relative position of what the question asks something about differs in relation to the preferential constructs of the subjects involved. Consequently, different subjects reach different conclusions. Problems arise when they try to assign objectivity to their conclusions or initiate action by denying validity to other conclusions. Let’s again take the example of the “vocalist question”. By virtue of it being a subjective question, different subjects will have different answers to it and if one of them then initiates action, such as declaring one of the vocalists as the winner, based solely on his conclusion, there’ll be trouble. However, this problem isn’t limited to subjective questions.</p>

<p>Every subject has a hierarchy of preferences. The structure of this hierarchy depends on the subject’s biological nature (i.e genetic makeup, hormone levels etc) and lived experiences (i.e memories of past interactions with the environment) and its actions are determined by it. This becomes more obvious in complex situations. Imagine that a human, along with his mother and wife, is on a sinking boat and there are only two life jackets available. In this scenario, he has four distinct options. He could - 1. Save his mother and himself 2. Save his wife and himself 3. Save his mother and wife, letting himself drown, or 4. Destroy the life jackets. Which one he will indeed choose depends on the structure of his preference hierarchy.</p>

<p>Depending on the specific structure of hierarchy a subject retains, as in having a higher preference for one thing, lesser for another, it can also develop preferences for certain solutions to objective questions. Not all solutions are right. Therefore, it follows that subjects are capable of developing preferences for wrong answers too. Manifestations of this phenomenon can be seen everywhere. People often deny accepting facts even after being proven wrong. They don’t do that because they are confident of their knowledge. They do that because, in their minds, they HAVE to be right. In their preference hierarchy, “don’t look like a fool” is situated higher than “truth at any cost”. As is evident, this can be quite problematic. Following is a diagram for further clarity.</p>

</a></p>

<h2 id="justification-of-beliefs">Justification of beliefs</h2>
<p>If preferences are intrinsically subjective and if all beliefs are predicated on preferences, does that mean all beliefs are justified?</p>

<p>No subject is above “preference” as they are the prime drivers of action and the beliefs of any subject are all regulated by its preferences. Nonetheless, the justification of beliefs depends solely on their validity as propositions and their validity depends on how consistent they are with reality (as has been mentioned already).</p>

<p>Let’s take the example of Adolf Hitler. His entire worldview was based on the belief of Aryan superiority. Whether he came to this conclusion because of his hatred for Jews (preference) or through pondering, I don’t know. But as a proposition, it isn’t justified as it’s not consistent with reality. Yet, throughout his entire life, he held on to it. Because he developed a preference for the proposition itself. At that stage, it didn’t matter to him whether his ideas were justified or not. He just didn’t care.</p>

<p>Let’s further take the example of a suicide bomber. A suicide bomber believes that the only way he can secure a place in heaven is by killing a bunch of “infidels” and sacrificing himself for God. Through whatever unreason he has come to this conclusion, his preference for this belief is even greater than his preference for survival. Yet, as a proposition, it isn’t justified, as it’s not consistent with reality. There’s no heaven up in the sky.</p>

<p>In actuality, when we criticize someone’s beliefs, we only question the validity of their beliefs as propositions. We don’t criticize their preference for the beliefs. We can’t. Because preferences are arbitrary and inherently subjective. Just as criticizing someone for their liking of a certain color doesn’t make sense, criticizing someone’s preference for a certain belief also doesn’t make sense. This is the essence of the “preference problem”. If someone doesn’t care about rationality (which is also a preference), it’s impossible to reason him out of unjustified (irrational) beliefs. Because he doesn’t care about justification or validity. He just wants to believe.</p>

<p>(Note that not all questions are objective. Questions like “who is the better singer” can’t be answered objectively. But central to the above two examples are propositions that are very much objectively determinable).</p>

<h2 id="the-nature-of-conflicts">The nature of conflicts</h2>
<p>Conflicts always arise out of preferential differences and that’s really obvious in case of inferior animals. Each of them holds the “preference to live” as prime and through evolution, animals on earth have evolved in such a way that to exercise this “prime” preference, they have to kill other living entities that also hold that same preference. This results in much conflict. Tigers are flesh-eating animals. They have to kill in order to live. So they kill cows, goats, dears etc. But these animals want to live as well. Hence, the chaos. In case of humans though, it’s much more subtle.</p>

<p>Consider the conflict between an atheist and a suicide bomber. At first glance, it seems to be a conflict of reason but on further contemplation, it becomes clear that the issue is deeper than that. Even though their beliefs have different degrees of validity, the core of the conflict doesn’t lie there. The atheist would happily settle the issue through debate, but the suicide bomber wouldn’t. That’s because the atheist cares about rationality and wants to live, the suicide bomber cares only about heaven and has no intention of living among mere mortals. This preferential difference is the source of the conflict. In order for an issue to be settled through debate, it requires that both parties are respectful of rationality. Although, that’s also a matter of preference. Some would rather blow things up, including themselves. Thus, suicide bombers exist.</p>

<p>(Note again that not all questions are objective. “Who is the better singer “ can’t be resolved through debate. It’s a subjective question. But whether heaven exists or not is certainly an objective one)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well then, what’s the solution to this mess? I don’t think there is one. If somehow the number of people who care about rationality increases, there’s a good chance that at least physical conflicts will slowly dissipate. I have also crafted a list of principles that, I think, if followed by a sufficient number of people, would decrease the number of physical conflicts. The principles are as follows -</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Determine whether a question is subjective or objective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understand that it’s futile to try to give objective answers to subjective questions. So it’s only rational to avoid fighting over such questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try to distance yourself from preferential biases whenever the heart of an issue is objectively determinable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try not to develop preferences that are, or could be, in conflict with someone else’s “preference to live”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>But as is clear, these principles are directly opposed to a lot of people’s already held preferences. Therefore, these probably wouldn’t be much effective as well.</p>

<p>So to end this essay, I will state the now obvious. As long as the capacity to hold preferences continues to permeate the entirety of conscious existence, suffering will prevail. That is to say that as long as there’s life, there will be suffering, for a conscious entity that doesn’t “wish” or “want” might as well be dead.</p>
